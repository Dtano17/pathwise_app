## 🧭 Transform Goals into Reality Using AI Planner  
**Built for doers. Designed to deliver.**

This is more than a productivity tool—it's your lifestyle companion. Whether you're chasing short-term wins or long-term transformations, this AI-powered mobile app helps you turn intentions into actionable plans and holds you accountable every step of the way.

### 🧠 What the App Does

- **Conversational Planning**  
  Speak or write your goals—“I want to work out, take vitamins, prep for my Dallas trip”—and the app curates a personalized, step-by-step plan.

- **Smart Sync**  
  Seamlessly integrates with your internal journal, iPhone Notes, Samsung Memo, calendar, maps, and notification system.

- **Swipe-Based Accountability**  
  Receive task reminders as swipeable cards:  
  - Swipe **right** = task completed → logged as a checkpoint  
  - Swipe **left** = task skipped → logged as missed  
  Each action updates your daily journal and feeds into your progress tracker.

- **AI Check-ins & Nudging Cadence**  
  You control how often the app nudges you—hourly, daily, weekly—based on your preferred cadence. Friendly pop-ups keep you on track without overwhelming you.

- **Future Projection**  
  Planning a trip or a lifestyle shift? The app anticipates your needs—lodging, transport, packing—and reminds you proactively.  
  Example: If you’ve chatted about a Dallas trip on October 10, the app will schedule reminders for transportation, accommodation, and packing essentials.

- **Stock Strategy Companion**  
  If you’ve discussed trading goals with ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, the app will extract your intent, devise a trading strategy, curate actionable steps (e.g., risk management, journaling, entry/exit alerts), and follow up on delivery. It becomes your AI-powered trading assistant.

- **Geotagging Accountability**  
  Future versions will confirm task completion via location—e.g., verifying you visited the gym, park, or airport as planned.

- **Lifestyle Pairing & Suggestions**  
  Discover new habits and activities inspired by users with similar goals—like hiking, journaling, cold plunges, or travel routines.

- **AI Companion Integration**  
  Sync with your favorite AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini for deeper insights and conversational support.
