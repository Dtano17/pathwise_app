See a recipe on Instagram? A workout on TikTok? A travel guide on YouTube? Share it to JournalMate and AI instantly turns it into YOUR personalized, actionable plan.

SHARE FROM ANYWHERE — YOUR SUPERPOWER
JournalMate is the only planner that lets you grab content from any app and own it:
• Share an Instagram Reel → Get a step-by-step meal plan with ingredients & budget
• Share a TikTok workout → Get a personalized fitness routine with scheduling
• Share a YouTube travel vlog → Get a complete trip itinerary with costs & bookings
• Paste a ChatGPT conversation → Get organized action items instantly
• Share any URL → AI extracts the key info and builds your plan

Our AI reads audio, captions, images (OCR), and text to extract everything — venues, prices, ingredients, exercises, destinations — then structures it into tasks you can track, schedule, and complete.
