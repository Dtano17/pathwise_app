## Technical Implementation

### 1. Confirmation Detection
```typescript
private detectConfirmation(message: string): 'yes' | 'no' | null {
  // Detects: yes, yeah, yep, sure, okay, ok, perfect, sounds good, etc.
  // Detects: no, nope, nah, not yet, i want to change, etc.
}
```

### 2. Plan States
- `_planState: 'confirming'` - Showing plan, waiting for yes/no
- `_planState: 'refining'` - User said no, collecting changes
- `_planState: 'confirmed'` - User said yes, ready to generate

### 3. Refinement Storage
```typescript
updatedSlots: {
  ...slots,
  _generatedPlan: enrichedPlan,      // Stores current plan
  _refinements: [...],                // Array of user changes
  _planState: 'confirming'            // Current state
}
```

### 4. Plan Regeneration
When user provides a change:
1. Extract refinement from user message
2. Add to refinements array
3. Pass refinements to `synthesizePlan()`
4. Claude incorporates changes into updated plan
5. Show updated plan with confirmation prompt

## User Commands

### Confirmation
- **Yes**: "yes", "yeah", "yep", "sure", "okay", "ok", "perfect", "sounds good", "looks good", "let's do it", "create it"
- **No**: "no", "nope", "nah", "not yet", "i want to change", "i want to add"

### Refinement
- Provide specific change: "Add more focus on X"
- Multiple changes: Each processed one at a time
- No changes: Say "none" to return to confirmation

## Generate Plan Button
Button appears ONLY when:
1. User has answered all questions
2. Plan has been generated
3. User has confirmed with "yes"
4. `showGenerateButton: true` is returned
5. Routes sets `showCreatePlanButton: true`

## Key Features
âœ… No more immediate "Generate Plan" after questions
âœ… User reviews plan before committing
âœ… One refinement at a time for clarity
âœ… Unlimited refinement cycles
âœ… "none" option to skip refinements
âœ… Clear yes/no prompts
âœ… Button appears only after confirmation
