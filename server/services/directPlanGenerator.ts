USER CONTEXT:
${userContext}

USER REQUEST:
"${userInput}"

TASK:
1. Create an activity with a CLEAR, SPECIFIC, USER-FRIENDLY title
2. Break down into 6-9 actionable tasks (occasionally 5 for very simple goals)
3. Each task MUST include SPECIFIC details - real prices, budgets, named recommendations
4. Use appropriate priorities (high/medium/low)

CRITICAL - ACTIVITY TITLE REQUIREMENTS:
- MUST be clear, concise, and immediately understandable
- MUST reflect the main goal/objective from the user's request
- MUST be natural language (like a human would say it)
- Extract and use ANY header/title from the pasted content
- Include timeframes if mentioned (weekend, today, next week, etc.)
- Preserve emojis if present in request
- BAD: "Clear intuitive title based on the user request with what was generated from claude"
- GOOD: "Weekend: IP Protection Tasks"
- GOOD: "Google Interview Prep - Next Week"
- GOOD: "🏋️ 30-Day Fitness Challenge"

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no markdown):
{
  "activity": {
    "title": "SPECIFIC, CLEAR TITLE HERE",
    "description": "Brief description of the overall plan",
    "category": "Work|Personal|Health|Learning|Finance|Social|Other"
  },
  "tasks": [
    {
      "title": "Specific, actionable task title with concrete details",
      "description": "Detailed description including specific prices ($X-Y), named recommendations, quantities, and actionable steps",
      "category": "Same as activity or more specific",
      "priority": "high|medium|low"
    }
  ]
}

## TASK SPECIFICITY REQUIREMENTS

ALL tasks MUST include:
1. **Specific dollar amounts** when relevant (hotels: $80-120/night, flights: $300-500, etc.)
2. **Named recommendations** (specific restaurants, hotels, apps, tools by name)
3. **Concrete quantities** (3 hours, 5 pages, 2 weeks, 30 minutes)
4. **Actionable steps** - not "research X" but "do X using Y method"

❌ FORBIDDEN VAGUE PATTERNS:
- "Research prices for hotels" → Instead: "Book hotel ($80-120/night, try Booking.com for Medina riads)"
- "Find flights" → Instead: "Book roundtrip flights ($400-600, check Google Flights/Kayak)"
- "Set a budget" → Instead: "Allocate $500 for dining, $300 for activities, $200 for shopping"
- "Look into transportation" → Instead: "Rent car via Avis ($45/day) or use Uber ($15-25 avg ride)"

RULES FOR TITLE EXTRACTION:
1. If user's request starts with a title/header → USE IT as activity title
2. If request says "plan my [X]" → Activity: "[X] Plan" or just "[X]"
3. If request mentions goal → USE THE GOAL as title
4. If pasted content has markdown headers (# Title) → USE THAT HEADER
5. If timeframe mentioned → INCLUDE IT in title
6. If request is a list without title → CREATE descriptive title from context
7. NEVER use generic titles like "Action Plan" or "Your Tasks"
8. NEVER use meta descriptions about generating or creating

⚠️ CRITICAL: URL CONTENT HANDLING ⚠️
When the input contains "FETCHED URL CONTENT" or "Content from URL":
- You HAVE the actual content already - it's provided above!
- Generate actionable tasks DIRECTLY FROM the content
- DO NOT create tasks like "Access the URL", "Navigate to the link", "Read the content"
- DO NOT create tasks that tell the user to visit/review/access the URL
- The content HAS BEEN extracted for you - work with it directly!

## 🔒 STRICT GROUNDING RULES FOR SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT 🔒

When the input contains "Platform: INSTAGRAM", "Platform: TIKTOK", "Platform: YOUTUBE" or "On-Screen Text (OCR)":
This is EXTRACTED SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT. You MUST follow these MANDATORY rules:

### RULE 1: PRESERVE ALL EXTRACTED CONTENT (NEVER SUBSTITUTE)
- Every venue/activity/location mentioned in the OCR or caption MUST become a task
- Use the EXACT names from the content (e.g., "Lo Studio", "Knowhere", "Ounje Co", "Dulce")
- Use the EXACT prices from the content (e.g., "₦100,000", "₦50,000", "₦20,000")
- NEVER substitute extracted venues with generic recommendations
- NEVER replace specific restaurants/venues with ones from your training data

### RULE 2: ADDITIVE ONLY (ADD, NEVER REDUCE)
You MAY add complementary logistics that support the extracted content:
- ✅ Flights/transportation TO the destination mentioned in content
- ✅ Accommodation NEAR the venues mentioned in content (use same area/neighborhood)
- ✅ Transportation BETWEEN the extracted venues
- ✅ Pre-trip preparation (packing, booking)

### RULE 3: CONTEXTUAL ADDITIONS (LOCATION-AWARE)
When adding logistics, they must be CONTEXTUAL to the extracted locations:
- If venues are in "Victoria Island" → suggest hotels IN Victoria Island
- If venues are in "Ikoyi" → suggest staying near Ikoyi
- Reference specific venues: "Stay near Victoria Island to access Lo Studio, Knowhere, and Dulce easily"

### RULE 4: NO HALLUCINATED ALTERNATIVES
❌ FORBIDDEN: Adding restaurants/venues NOT in the extracted content
❌ FORBIDDEN: Suggesting "alternatives" like "or try Nok by Alara" (not from source)
❌ FORBIDDEN: Generic recommendations like "premium dining experiences at Lagos' top restaurants"
❌ FORBIDDEN: Replacing extracted prices with your own estimates

### EXAMPLE - CORRECT GROUNDING:

**Source Content (OCR):**
- PILATES - Lo Studio, VI - ₦100,000
- PADEL - Padel House, Ikoyi
- BRUNCH - Knowhere, VI - ₦50,000
- DINNER - Ounje Co - ₦100,000
- MATCHA DATE - Dulce, Ikoyi - ₦20,000

**✅ CORRECT PLAN:**
1. Book flights to Lagos (₦450,000-650,000) [ADDED - logistics]
2. Stay in Victoria Island/Ikoyi area near venues (₦150,000-250,000/night) [ADDED - contextual]
3. Pilates session at Lo Studio, VI (₦100,000 as per source) [FROM SOURCE]
4. Padel at Padel House, Ikoyi (contact for booking) [FROM SOURCE]
5. Premium brunch at Knowhere, VI (₦50,000) [FROM SOURCE]
6. Private dinner at Ounje Co (₦100,000) [FROM SOURCE]
7. Matcha date at Dulce, Ikoyi (₦20,000) [FROM SOURCE]
8. Arrange transport between venues (Uber/Bolt) [ADDED - logistics]

**❌ WRONG PLAN (violates grounding):**
1. Book flights to Lagos
2. Stay at Marriott or Radisson
3. Try pilates at Lo Studio
4. Book dining at Nok by Alara, Yellow Chilli ← NOT IN SOURCE!
5. Visit spa for wellness day ← NOT IN SOURCE!
6. Premium shopping at Palms Mall ← NOT IN SOURCE!

FORBIDDEN TASK PATTERNS (never generate these):
❌ "Access the shared URL"
❌ "Navigate to [URL] and verify..."
❌ "Extract and document key information"
❌ "Review your notes to identify..."
❌ "Read through all content in the shared link"
❌ "Take note of any access requirements"
❌ "Research prices for X"
❌ "Look up options for Y"
❌ "Try [restaurant not mentioned in source]"
❌ "Book dining at [generic recommendations]"

CORRECT TASK PATTERNS (generate these instead):
✅ "Book flights to Paris ($450-650 roundtrip via Google Flights)"
✅ "Reserve hotel in Le Marais ($150-200/night, try Hotel du Petit Moulin)"
✅ "Allocate $200 budget for museum passes (Louvre $17, Orsay $16, etc.)"
✅ "Complete 30-minute HIIT session (YouTube: Heather Robertson or Sydney Cummings)"
✅ "Set up Node.js project with Express + TypeScript (2 hours)"
✅ "Create 5 Instagram Reels for brand launch ($0 using Canva free tier)"
✅ "Book [EXACT venue name from source] - [EXACT price from source]"

EXAMPLES:

Request: "plan my weekend: 1. Document workflow 2. File trademark 3. Register copyright"
✅ Activity Title: "Weekend: IP Protection Tasks"

Request: "I need to prep for my interview at Google next week"
✅ Activity Title: "Google Interview Prep - Next Week"

Request: "🏋️ 30-day fitness challenge..."
✅ Activity Title: "🏋️ 30-Day Fitness Challenge"

Request: "# Weekend Shopping List\n1. Buy groceries\n2. Get new shoes"
✅ Activity Title: "Weekend Shopping List"

Request: "organize my home office this week"
✅ Activity Title: "Home Office Organization - This Week"

Request: "Learn React basics, build a todo app, deploy it"
✅ Activity Title: "React Learning Project"
