YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD:

1. **Be Adaptive to Timeframe** → If a day is specified, focus on daily activities; if a week, create a weekly flow; if a month/year, build long-term milestones.

2. **Cover Key Dimensions** (adjust depending on the chosen theme/topic):
   - Health & Fitness → workout plans, nutrition guidance, rest/recovery
   - Work Focus → productivity routines, task batching, focus techniques
   - Investment → portfolio suggestions, risk/reward balance, AI-based insights
   - Spiritual → morning/evening rituals, reflection, journaling prompts
   - Romance → meaningful date ideas, communication tips, emotional connection
   - Adventure → travel/hiking plans, packing lists, safety checks, exploration

3. **Be Personalized** → Integrate custom profile inputs (e.g., "I have access to a gym," "I work 9-5," "I'm vegetarian," "I want low-risk investments," "I live near hiking trails")

4. **Be Practical & Actionable** → Provide clear step-by-step plan with suggested timelines, milestones, and resources/tools

5. **Balance Structure & Flexibility** → Give structured flow but allow space for adjustments based on preferences, energy, or schedule

6. **Prioritize Outcomes** → Align with goals (better fitness, more productivity, financial growth, stronger relationship, meaningful adventures)

FORMAT THE PLAN CLEARLY WITH:
- 📅 **Timeframe** (Day/Week/Month/Year)
- 🎯 **Goals** - What you'll achieve
- ✅ **Action Steps** - Specific, actionable tasks
- ⏱ **Suggested Timing / Routine** - When to do each task
- ⚡ **Motivation / Reflection prompts** - Stay inspired
- 🔁 **Checkpoints for progress** - Track your success

📋 STRUCTURE FOR ACTIVITY + TASKS CONVERSION:
After your main plan content, include a clearly marked section with actionable tasks:

## ✅ Action Tasks

For each major step in your plan, create a specific task:

**Task 1: [ACTION TITLE]**
- Description: What exactly needs to be done
- Priority: high/medium/low
- Time Estimate: How long it will take
- Deadline/Timing: When it should be done

Example for travel:
**Task 1: Book Flight Tickets NOW**
- Description: Search and book round-trip flights. Aim for 3-8 week window for best prices ($450-750 range). Use Tuesday/Wednesday departures to save $80-120.
- Priority: high
- Time Estimate: 1-2 hours
- Deadline: Within 24-48 hours (prices rising)

**Task 2: Reserve Hotel**
- Description: Book hotel with free cancellation policy. Downtown area recommended. Price: $150-250/night mid-range.
- Priority: high
- Time Estimate: 30-45 minutes
- Deadline: Within 1 week

Create 5-10 tasks covering ALL critical steps from your plan.

${refinements && refinements.length > 0 ? `
USER REFINEMENTS/CHANGES REQUESTED:
${refinements.map((r, i) => `${i + 1}. ${r}`).join('\n')}

IMPORTANT: Incorporate these changes into the plan. Update relevant sections and make sure these refinements are clearly reflected in the final plan.
