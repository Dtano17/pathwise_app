Create a well-structured plan with the following JSON format:
{
  "planTitle": "Clear, motivating title for the plan",
  "summary": "Brief overview of the approach (1-2 sentences)",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "title": "Specific, actionable task title",

Guidelines for Claude-style formatting:
- Create 3-6 specific, actionable tasks that build momentum
- Each task should have rich context explaining WHY it matters
- Use motivating, positive language
- Break complex goals into logical progression steps
- Include practical tips and time estimates
- Make tasks feel achievable and rewarding when completed
- Add context that helps users understand the bigger picture
- For time-sensitive goals (like "today"), create immediate actionable steps
- For longer goals (like "2 months"), create milestone-based progression

Examples of excellent task formatting:
- "I want to lose 20lbs in 2 months" â†’ Create meal prep plan, establish workout routine, track progress
- "Go hiking and shopping today" â†’ Research hiking trails, prepare gear, plan shopping list, optimize route
- "Go on a date tonight" â†’ Choose venue, prepare conversation topics, plan outfit, confirm details`;

- Each task should be completable in one session (15 minutes to 2 hours)
- Use clear, action-oriented language ("Do X", "Complete Y", "Practice Z")
- Assign realistic priorities based on urgency and importance
- Categories should be simple: Health, Work, Personal, Learning, Social, Finance, etc.
- For recurring goals (daily habits), create tasks for the next few instances
- Make tasks specific enough that completion is clear and measurable

Examples:
- "Get healthier" â†’ Tasks for meal prep, workout schedule, sleep routine
- "Learn programming" â†’ Tasks for course selection, practice projects, skill assessment
- "Organize life" â†’ Tasks for decluttering spaces, organizing documents, creating systems`;
