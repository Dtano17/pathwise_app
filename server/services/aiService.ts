Create a well-structured plan with the following JSON format:
{
  "planTitle": "Clear, motivating title for the plan",
  "summary": "Brief overview of the approach (1-2 sentences)",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "title": "Specific, actionable task title",

Guidelines for Claude-style formatting:
- Create 3-6 specific, actionable tasks that build momentum
- Each task should have rich context explaining WHY it matters
- Use motivating, positive language
- Break complex goals into logical progression steps
- Include practical tips and time estimates
- Make tasks feel achievable and rewarding when completed
- Add context that helps users understand the bigger picture
- For time-sensitive goals (like "today"), create immediate actionable steps
- For longer goals (like "2 months"), create milestone-based progression

Examples of excellent task formatting:
- "I want to lose 20lbs in 2 months" → Create meal prep plan, establish workout routine, track progress
- "Go hiking and shopping today" → Research hiking trails, prepare gear, plan shopping list, optimize route
- "Go on a date tonight" → Choose venue, prepare conversation topics, plan outfit, confirm details`;

Guidelines:
- Break down complex goals into 2-5 specific, actionable tasks
- Each task should be completable in one session (15 minutes to 2 hours)
- Use clear, action-oriented language ("Do X", "Complete Y", "Practice Z")
- Assign realistic priorities based on urgency and importance
- Categories should be simple: Health, Work, Personal, Learning, Social, Finance, etc.
- For recurring goals (daily habits), create tasks for the next few instances
- Make tasks specific enough that completion is clear and measurable

Examples:
- "Get healthier" → Tasks for meal prep, workout schedule, sleep routine
- "Learn programming" → Tasks for course selection, practice projects, skill assessment
- "Organize life" → Tasks for decluttering spaces, organizing documents, creating systems`;

Example: Context='plan my weekend' + Pasted='🔐 Securing IP' → Title='🔐 Weekend Plans: Securing IP for Your Agentic Framework'. NEVER use 'Generated Plan'!",

      "dueDate": null
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Brief summary of the overall plan",
  "estimatedTimeframe": "Realistic timeframe to complete everything",
  "motivationalNote": "Encouraging note to help the user get started"
}

IMPORTANT: If the image shows numbered steps (1., 2., 3., etc.) or bullet points, convert EACH ONE into a separate task. For example, if you see "1. Document Your Workflow", "2. File a Trademark", "3. Register Copyright" - create 3 separate tasks, not one combined task.

CRITICAL RULES FOR ACTIVITY TITLE (MANDATORY - FOLLOW EXACTLY):
1. READ the preceding context to find what the user wants (e.g., "plan my weekend with this")
2. EXTRACT the main title/header from the pasted content (usually the first line, often has emojis)
3. COMBINE them using this exact pattern:

   Pattern: [Emoji from pasted content] + [Timeframe/Action from context] + [Title from pasted content]

   Examples:
   - Context: "plan my weekend with this" + Pasted: "🔐 Securing IP for Your Agentic Framework"
     → Activity Title: "🔐 Weekend Plans: Securing IP for Your Agentic Framework"

   - Context: "help me organize this for next week" + Pasted: "🏋️ Fitness Transformation Plan"
     → Activity Title: "🏋️ Next Week: Fitness Transformation Plan"

   - Context: "I want to do this today" + Pasted: "📚 Learn Python Basics"
     → Activity Title: "📚 Today: Learn Python Basics"

4. ALWAYS extract the header from the pasted content - look for the first line or lines with emojis
5. NEVER use generic titles like "Generated Plan", "Your Action Plan", "New Activity", etc.
6. PRESERVE ALL emojis from the pasted content (🔐, ™️, ©️, 🧪, 🧾, 🏋️, 📚, etc.)

Guidelines:
- Break down the content into 3-8 actionable tasks
- Extract each numbered step or major bullet point as a separate task
- Make tasks specific, measurable, and achievable
- Extract key details from sub-bullets into task descriptions
- Use the preceding context to understand the user's intent and timeframe`

Example: If the pasted content is:

 2. File a Trademark - Protect your brand name
 3. Register Copyright - Protect your codebase"

Create 3 separate tasks:
- Task 1: title="Document Your Workflow", description="Create a clean, timestamped record of your agentic logic..."
- Task 2: title="File a Trademark", description="Protect your brand name (e.g. JournalMate), logo, and tagline..."
