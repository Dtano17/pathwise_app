## 🔍 Things to Watch For

### ✅ Expected Behaviors:
1. **No repeated questions** - Each question asked only once
2. **Progress tracking** - Shows "3/5 questions (60%)"
3. **Smart extraction** - If you say "3 days" it captures it automatically
4. **Beautiful formatting** - Emojis, markdown, sections
5. **Domain detection** - Correctly identifies travel vs interview vs date planning

### ❌ Red Flags (Report These):
1. **Same question asked twice**
2. **Generate Plan button never enables**
3. **No progress indicator**
4. **Generic text responses** (no emojis or formatting)
5. **Errors in console**

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

Once you run the server in Replit:
1. Test Quick Plan with travel example above
2. Verify Generate Plan button enables after 5 questions
3. Check that plan is beautifully formatted
4. Test Smart Plan with interview example
5. Verify no loops/repeated questions

**If all 5 tests pass → System is working!** ✅

## 💡 Tips for Testing

1. **Watch the console** - We added extensive logging
2. **Check Network tab** - Verify API calls succeed
3. **Test with different domains** - Try fitness, daily planning, date night
4. **Mix it up** - Put multiple info in one message: "Dallas, 3 days, $500, leisure, flying"
5. **Test the loop fix** - Repeat the same answer to verify no repeat question
