# IntentAI - AI-Powered Journaling Application

### Overview
IntentAI is an AI-powered journaling application designed to transform user intentions into actionable plans. It provides a mobile-first experience with features like swipeable task management, celebratory feedback, and comprehensive authentication. The application aims to be a lifestyle planner that guides users through setting, executing, and celebrating their goals, integrating advanced AI for intelligent planning and personalized journaling.

### User Preferences
- Wants fully functional authentication with Facebook support
- Requires separate Supabase-based Facebook OAuth (not Replit Auth)
- Needs Priorities and Settings tabs to be fully functional
- Values real user data persistence (no hardcoded demo users)
- Mobile-first design approach
- Clean, modern interface design
- Real AI integration (Claude/OpenAI)

### Data Persistence & Demo User Behavior
**Demo User (Unauthenticated Users):**
- Demo user data is stored in the PostgreSQL database with a persistent `DEMO_USER_ID = "demo-user"`
- **Most features** (activities, tasks, journal entries, feedback) persist indefinitely across browser sessions and page refreshes
- **Planner sessions only** use session-scoped IDs (getDemoUserId) to prevent state collision between different browser tabs/windows
- **Expected Behavior**: Demo activity/task/journal data persists indefinitely until manually cleared via database cleanup
- **Production Note**: Demo user data can be periodically cleaned up via scheduled jobs if needed
- **Limitation**: All unauthenticated users share the same demo data, which may cause confusion in multi-user scenarios

**Authenticated Users:**
- All user data persists permanently in the PostgreSQL database
- Each user has a unique ID from their authentication provider (Google, Facebook, X/Twitter, Apple, Email)
- Data includes: journal entries, activities, tasks, custom categories, feedback, preferences, and planner sessions
- Data syncs across all devices when logged in
- Each user's data is completely isolated from other users

### System Architecture
The application employs a mobile-first responsive design featuring a clean, card-based UI with a purple and emerald color scheme and the Inter font family, providing immediate, celebration-focused feedback.

**Technical Stack:**
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Wouter
- **Backend**: Express.js with Passport.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) with Drizzle ORM
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI and Claude API with automatic provider switching and cost optimization.
- **Authentication**: Dual system with Replit Auth (Google, X/Twitter, Apple, Email) and Supabase (Facebook OAuth), unified via Passport.js.
- **Animations**: React Confetti, React Spring, Framer Motion.
- **Mobile Application**: React Native/Expo app for iOS and Android, located in the `mobile/` folder.

**Core Features:**
- **AI-Powered Planning**: 
  - **Quick Plan (5-question flow)**: Streamlined planning in 3 turns - Batch 1 asks 3 questions (origin, destination, duration), Batch 2 asks 2 more (budget, occasion), then shows preview with real-time data. Features automatic safety checks for travel (hurricanes, advisories), strict override detection to prevent accidental skips, and user can override at any point by saying "create plan".
  - **Smart Plan (10-question flow)**: Comprehensive planning with detailed research, real-time data enrichment, and 3-batch question flow.
  - Both modes feature dynamic validation, progress tracking, zero hallucination enforcement, context-aware completion, enhanced task generation, and domain-agnostic question prioritization (not hardcoded).
- **Freemium Revenue Model**: Stripe-powered subscription system with three tiers:
  - **Free**: 5 AI plans/month + unlimited real-time data enrichment (weather, safety, events)
  - **Pro** ($6.99/mo): Unlimited AI plans, smart favorites, journal insights, export, 7-day trial
  - **Family** ($14.99/mo): Everything in Pro + up to 5 users, collaborative planning, 7-day trial
  - Annual plans available with 30% discount. Plan usage tracking with automatic monthly reset.
- **Task Management**: Swipeable task cards, YouTube-style feedback, real-time progress dashboard with streaks and analytics, search/filter, and automatic activity/task creation upon plan confirmation.
- **Personal Journal**: Interface with 9 categories, auto-save, and backend persistence. Includes a "Journal Mode" for smart capture of text and media (photos/videos), with AI-driven categorization and enrichment.
- **Social Sharing & Activity Management**: Customizable share previews, NYC-themed backdrops, custom images, and an AI-powered "Privacy Shield" for PII/PHI redaction. Includes automatic activity copying for visitors, duplicate detection with an update system, and activity history/archiving.
- **Community Plans Discovery**: Users can browse and copy plans from others, featuring trending algorithms, category filters, and one-click "Use This Plan" functionality.
- **Groups & Collaborative Planning**: Basic group creation and viewing. Future features include contributor change proposals, admin approval queues, real-time change logs, and personal vs. canonical versions with conflict resolution.
- **Authentication & User Management**: Unified authentication, functional profile management (Priorities & Settings), and access control.
- **UI/UX**: Mobile-first, responsive, dark/light theme toggle, adaptive layouts, and accessibility.
- **SEO**: About tab optimized with relevant keywords.

### Production Deployment
**Important**: API keys configured in development are **separate from production secrets**.

To deploy to production:
1. **Configure Production Secrets** (see `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed guide):
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Required for AI planning
   - `TAVILY_API_KEY` - Required for real-time data enrichment
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Required for subscription billing
   - `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` - Required for checkout flow
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Optional for Claude models
   - `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` - Optional for DeepSeek models
   
2. **Configure Stripe Products** (see `REVENUE_SYSTEM.md`):
