# JournalMate Social Sharing Video Script

## VERSION 1: "The Group Chat Is Tired" (Main Cut)
**Format:** 75-85 seconds | Selfie talking head + screen recordings
**Tone:** That friend who found something and WON'T shut up about it (in the best way)
**Vibe:** Walking, animated, mid-conversation energy -- like you're 3 minutes into a story

---

### HOOK (0-3s)
*[You, mid-stride, talking to camera like you just remembered something]*

**"Okay wait -- raise your hand if your group chat has ever imploded over plans."**

*On-screen text:* **"the planning curse is real"**

---

### THE SPIRAL (3-12s)
*[Still walking, picking up energy, talking with your hands]*

**"Because here's how it goes every time. Someone drops a TikTok in the chat -- 'omg we HAVE to do this.' Everyone hypes it up. Then nobody actually plans it. Three weeks later that reel is buried under 400 messages and the vibe is dead. We've all been there. The graveyard of plans that never happened."**

*On-screen text:* **"the graveyard of plans"**

---

### THE SHIFT (12-18s)
*[Stop walking. Look directly at camera. Lower your voice slightly -- this is the "real talk" moment]*

**"So I stopped waiting for someone else to be the planner. And I found something that actually changed how my whole friend group operates."**

*Cut to: Phone in hand, app opening*

---

### IMPORT THE INSPO (18-30s)
*[Screen recording with voiceover -- energy picks back up]*

**"You know that restaurant reel your friend sent you? That Pinterest board you've been hoarding? That Reddit thread about hidden gems in your city? Instead of letting all that die in your saves folder..."**

*Show: Pasting an Instagram/TikTok URL into the import screen*

**"...you literally paste it right here. Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Reddit -- it eats everything. And it doesn't just save the link. It turns it into an actual plan. With steps. With a timeline. With a budget breakdown."**

*Show: URL being processed --> AI conversation flowing --> full plan generated with tasks*

*On-screen text:* **"from saved reel to actual plan in 60 seconds"**

---

### THE AI PLANS (30-42s)
*[Screen recording continues, conversational voiceover]*

**"And it's not some generic template either. You pick Quick Plan if you want something fast -- it asks you 5 questions and just... builds it. Or Smart Plan if you want it to go deeper -- it knows your location, your vibe, what's actually around you."**

*Show: Quick Plan conversation (5 questions) --> switch to Smart Plan with location detection*

**"It's like having that one friend who's annoyingly good at planning -- except it's in your pocket and it doesn't judge you for being indecisive."**

---

### THE GROUP MAGIC (42-55s)
*[This is the centerpiece -- screen recording of group features]*

**"But here's where it gets good. You make a group -- your couple, your friend group, your roommates, whatever. Share the plan to the group, and now everyone's got it. Everyone sees the tasks. Everyone checks stuff off."**

*Show: Creating/opening a group --> sharing an activity to the group --> member progress visible*

**"No more 'hey did you book the reservation?' No more 'wait I thought YOU were doing that.' The progress is right there. You can literally see who's pulling their weight and who's... not."**

*Show: Group activity feed --> task completion updates --> member progress bars*

*On-screen text:* **"accountability hits different when it's visible"**

---

### THE REWARDS DROP (55-65s)
*[Back to you, leaning into camera with "let me tell you a secret" energy]*

**"And here's the part nobody's talking about yet. If you're that friend who always plans everything? You actually get rewarded for it now. Publish your plans to the community, earn credits when people save them. Someone actually completes a plan you made? More credits. You're basically getting paid to be the planner friend."**

*Show: Credits dashboard --> community publish flow --> credit notification popping up*

*On-screen text:* **"the planner friend era"**

---

### THE COMMUNITY (65-73s)
*[Screen recording -- Discover tab]*

**"And if you're NOT the planner friend -- respect -- just browse what other people already built. Date nights, weekend trips, fitness plans, interview prep. Thousands of plans from people who actually did the thing. Just grab one and make it yours."**

*Show: Discover page --> trending plans --> category filters --> adopting a plan with one tap*

---

### THE CLOSE (73-83s)
*[Back to you. Genuine energy -- not "ad read" energy. Like you're wrapping up a conversation.]*

**"We went from a group chat full of 'we should totally do that' to actually doing things every weekend. My saved folder isn't a graveyard anymore. And honestly? Being the planner friend finally pays off."**

*[Slight pause, half-smile]*

**"JournalMate. Link's in my bio. Go be the friend that actually makes things happen."**

*On-screen text:* **"JournalMate -- turn 'we should' into 'we did'"**
*Show: App icon + download link*

---

## VERSION 2: "Planner Friend Payback" (Short Cut - 30-40s)
**Format:** TikTok/Reels quick hit | Designed for saves and shares
**Best for:** Targeting the "planner friend" audience specifically

---

### HOOK (0-2s)
**"If you're the friend who always has to plan everything -- this is your moment."**

*On-screen text:* **"for the planner friends"**

### BODY (2-25s)
*[Screen recording montage with fast, punchy voiceover]*

**"Someone sends you a reel? Paste it. It becomes a real plan. Share it with your group. Everyone sees the tasks, checks stuff off, no more chasing people down. And the best part? You actually earn credits when people use your plans. The more people save what you build, the more you earn. Being organized finally has a reward system."**

*Show: URL paste --> plan generated --> shared to group --> credits earned notification*

### CLOSE (25-35s)
*[Back to camera]*

**"Stop planning for free. JournalMate. Link in bio."**

*On-screen text:* **"get credit for being the organized one"**

**Format:** Pure storytelling | No hard sell energy | Designed for watch time + shares
**Best for:** Organic reach, algorithm-friendly, high completion rate

---

### HOOK (0-3s)
*[Talking to camera, casual, like continuing a conversation]*

**"Okay so last month my girlfriend sent me this reel of a rooftop bar downtown. And for the first time, we actually went."**

### THE STORY (3-35s)
**"Normally that reel would've sat in my saves for three months and died. But this time I pasted the link into this app I've been using -- and it literally turned the reel into a full date night plan. Reservation time, what to order, a dessert spot nearby, even parking."**

*Show: Screen recording of the import --> plan with tasks and details*

**"I shared it to our little couples group in the app so she could see the plan too. She checked off the outfit task -- yes that's a real task -- and I handled the reservation. We could both see where things were at. No 'did you do it?' texts."**

*Show: Group view --> both members' progress --> task check-offs*

**"We went. It was perfect. I journaled about it after -- the app even pulled in photos of the venue and enriched the whole entry."**

*Show: Journal entry with venue photos*

### THE CLOSE (35-50s)
*[Genuine, reflective tone]*

**"We used to let every cool thing we saw online just... stay online. Now we actually do them. That's the whole pitch. JournalMate -- link in bio."**

*On-screen text:* **"stop saving. start doing."**

## FILMING NOTES

### What Makes This Script Different
- **No "hey guys" intro.** You start mid-energy, mid-thought. Like you pressed record 10 seconds late.
- **No feature list.** Every feature is wrapped in a story or a feeling. The viewer learns what the app does without ever feeling sold to.
- **The "planner friend" angle** is the emotional hook. Everyone knows this person (or IS this person). It's instantly shareable because people will tag their planner friend.
- **Credits/rewards** are positioned as justice, not a feature. "Finally getting paid for what you already do."

### Technical Tips
- **Screen recordings:** Use dark mode. Record on your actual phone, not a simulator.
- **Talking head:** Film outside or near a window. Natural light > ring light for this format. Walk while you talk -- movement keeps attention.
- **Audio:** If recording outdoors, do a separate voiceover pass for the screen recording sections. Keep the walking sections as live audio (imperfections = authenticity).
- **Captions:** Always add captions. 80%+ of viewers watch muted initially. Use a bold, slightly offset caption style (not centered-bottom default).
- **Pacing:** Cut every 2-3 seconds during screen recordings. Don't show full loading times. Jump cut between states.
- **Music:** Use trending audio underneath at 15-20% volume during screen recording sections. Full volume only during transitions.

### Posting Strategy
- **Main cut (V1):** Post to TikTok and Instagram Reels simultaneously. Use the hashtags: #planningapp #planwithme #friendgroup #weekendplans #organizedlife
- **Short cut (V2):** Post 2-3 days after V1 as a "Part 2" or standalone. Target the "planner friend" niche specifically.
- **Story cut (V3):** Best for organic reach. Post when you want the algorithm to reward watch time over engagement.
- **Silent cut (V4):** Use for App Store preview, pinned Instagram post, or website embed.
