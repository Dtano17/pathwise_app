# Expo Router Migration Complete

## What Changed

The mobile app has been successfully migrated from React Navigation to Expo Router (the official routing solution for Expo SDK 54+).

### Key Changes:

1. **Routing System**: File-based routing with Expo Router instead of imperative React Navigation
2. **Entry Point**: Changed from custom `index.js` to `expo-router/entry`
3. **Babel Configuration**: Added `expo-router/babel` plugin
4. **Directory Structure**: 
   - Old: `src/screens/` with manual navigation setup
   - New: `app/` directory with automatic file-based routing

### New File Structure:

```
mobile/
├── app/
│   ├── _layout.tsx          # Root layout (Stack navigator)
│   ├── auth.tsx             # Authentication screen
│   └── (tabs)/              # Tab group
│       ├── _layout.tsx      # Tab layout (Bottom tabs)
│       ├── index.tsx        # Home screen (/)
│       ├── plan.tsx         # Planning screen (/plan)
│       ├── journal.tsx      # Journal screen (/journal)
│       └── profile.tsx      # Profile screen (/profile)
├── src/
│   ├── components/          # Shared components
│   ├── constants/           # Colors, config
│   ├── services/            # API client
│   └── types/               # TypeScript types
└── package.json             # Updated with expo-router
```

### Removed Files:

- `App.tsx` (replaced by `app/_layout.tsx`)
- `index.js` (replaced by `expo-router/entry`)
- `metro.config.js` (no longer needed)
- `src/screens/` (moved to `app/(tabs)/`)
- `src/navigation/` (replaced by file-based routing)

### Benefits:

1. **Simpler Navigation**: No need to manually configure navigators
2. **Better Developer Experience**: File-based routing is more intuitive
3. **Official Support**: Expo Router is the recommended solution for Expo SDK 54+
4. **Type Safety**: Automatic TypeScript types for routes
5. **Performance**: Optimized for Expo Go and production builds

### Testing:

To test the app:
```bash
cd mobile
npm start
```

Then scan the QR code with Expo Go app on your iOS/Android device.

## Troubleshooting:

If you see any errors:
1. Clear all caches: `rm -rf node_modules/.cache .expo`
2. Restart Metro: `npx expo start --clear --reset-cache`
3. Reinstall dependencies if needed

## Next Steps:

- Update `package-lock.json` by running `npm install` in the mobile directory
- Test all screens in Expo Go
- Verify navigation flows (auth → tabs, logout → auth)
