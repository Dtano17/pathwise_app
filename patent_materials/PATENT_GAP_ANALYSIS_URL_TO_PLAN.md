## 🎯 **KEY LANGUAGE TO INCLUDE IN CLAIMS**

### **Field of Invention Section:**
```
The present invention relates to artificial intelligence-powered content 
transformation systems and methods. More particularly, the invention relates 
to systems and methods for extracting multi-modal content from social media 
platforms including Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and others; analyzing the 
extracted content using optical character recognition (OCR), audio 
transcription, and natural language processing; and transforming unstructured 
social media content into structured, actionable plans using artificial 
intelligence models, with intelligent caching, platform-specific extraction 
strategies, and operating system-level share sheet integration.
```

### **Critical Terminology to Use:**

1. **"Multi-modal content extraction"** - emphasizes OCR + audio + text combination
2. **"Social media content ingestion"** - covers receiving URLs/content from external platforms

## 📋 **SAMPLE INDEPENDENT CLAIM (Claim 1)**

```
1. A computer-implemented method for transforming social media content into 
executable action plans, the method comprising:

receiving, via an operating system share sheet or URL input interface, a 
social media URL from a platform selected from the group consisting of 
Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest;

detecting a platform type of the social media URL based on URL structure 
and domain analysis;

applying a platform-specific extraction strategy corresponding to the 
detected platform type, wherein:
  - for Instagram URLs, the extraction strategy detects and processes 
    carousel posts, single images, or reels, extracting caption text and 
    performing optical character recognition (OCR) on visual content;
  - for TikTok URLs, the extraction strategy extracts video content, 
    performs audio transcription of spoken content, and performs OCR on 
    on-screen text overlays;
  - for YouTube URLs, the extraction strategy extracts video metadata, 
    retrieves available transcripts or performs audio transcription, and 
    performs OCR on video frames;

normalizing the social media URL by removing tracking parameters and 
standardizing URL format to a canonical form;

querying a cache storage system using the normalized URL to determine 
whether previously extracted content exists;

if cached content exists, retrieving the previously extracted content 
from cache;

if cached content does not exist:
  - executing the platform-specific extraction strategy to obtain raw 
    content comprising at least one of: caption text, OCR-extracted text, 
    audio transcript, metadata, or image data;
  - storing the extracted content in the cache storage system associated 
    with the normalized URL;

combining multiple modalities of extracted content into a unified content 
representation comprising textual and contextual information;

transmitting the unified content representation to an artificial 
intelligence model API with instructions to transform the social media 
content into a structured action plan;

receiving from the artificial intelligence model API a generated action 
plan comprising:
  - a plan title derived from the social media content;
  - a plurality of actionable tasks with descriptions, estimated time 
    requirements, and priority levels;
  - budget estimates when applicable;
  - scheduling recommendations;

storing the generated action plan in a database accessible to the user; and

displaying the action plan in a user interface enabling task completion 
tracking, editing, and sharing.
```

## 🔧 **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS TO INCLUDE**

### **Detailed Description Section Should Cover:**

1. **Platform Detection Algorithm:**
```
The system analyzes URL patterns to identify social media platforms:
- Instagram: instagram.com/p/, instagram.com/reel/, instagram.com/stories/
- TikTok: tiktok.com/@*/video/*, vm.tiktok.com/*
- YouTube: youtube.com/watch?v=*, youtu.be/*, youtube.com/shorts/*
Each pattern triggers platform-specific extraction pipelines optimized 
for that platform's content structure.
```

2. **OCR Processing:**
```
Optical character recognition is performed on visual content using [OCR 
library name] to extract on-screen text including:
- Recipe ingredients and measurements
- Workout instructions and rep counts
- Travel itinerary details
- Product lists and specifications
- Tutorial steps and instructions
The OCR system preprocesses images for text optimization, applies language 
detection, and filters low-confidence extractions.
```

3. **Audio Transcription:**
```
Audio content is extracted from video URLs and processed through 
[transcription service/model] to convert spoken words into text. 
Transcription includes:
- Spoken instructions and narration
- Verbal tips and recommendations
- Conversation content relevant to planning
- Background audio context when applicable
Transcriptions are timestamped and confidence-scored.
```

4. **AI Transformation Methodology:**
```
The unified content representation is transmitted to an AI model (e.g., 
GPT-4, Claude) with specialized prompts instructing:
- Identification of actionable items within unstructured content
- Extraction of sequential steps from narrative content
- Budget estimation based on mentioned costs or activity types
- Timeline creation from temporal information
- Priority assignment based on content emphasis
The AI model applies domain-specific knowledge (fitness, travel, cooking, 
learning, etc.) to generate contextually appropriate plans.
```

5. **Caching Strategy:**
```
URL content caching implements a permanent storage mechanism wherein 
successfully extracted content is stored indefinitely to prevent redundant 
processing. Cache entries include:
- Normalized URL as primary key
- Extracted content (caption, OCR text, transcript)
- Extraction timestamp
- Platform identifier
- Extraction source (social media service vs. fallback extraction)
- Word count and metadata
Cache hits reduce processing time from 10-30 seconds to milliseconds.
