<h1>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CATEGORIZING, RANKING, AND DISTRIBUTING AI-POWERED COMMUNITY PLANS WITH PLAN MONETIZATION STRATEGY</h1>

<h2>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</h2>

<p>The present invention relates generally to artificial intelligence-powered planning and content distribution systems. More particularly, the invention relates to systems and methods for generating, categorizing, ranking, monetizing, and distributing AI-generated community plans using location-based and real-time data, with mechanisms for community sharing, copying, editing, and ownership of plans based on user-defined budget controls, filtering criteria, and priority systems.</p>

<h2>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h2>

<p>Traditional planning systems and content distribution platforms suffer from several fundamental limitations. First, conventional planning tools require users to manually research, compile, and organize information from disparate sources, resulting in significant time investment and incomplete or outdated information. Users seeking to plan travel, events, or activities must consult multiple websites, manually verify current conditions, and cross-reference information across platforms.</p>

<p>Second, existing content sharing platforms lack intelligent categorization systems that prioritize content based on urgency, commercial value, popularity trends, and community relevance. Content is typically presented chronologically or through simplistic popularity metrics that fail to account for time-sensitive information, sponsored content value, or emergency situations requiring immediate user attention.</p>

<p>Third, current systems do not effectively integrate location-based real-time data into AI-generated plans. Users receive static plans that quickly become outdated when weather conditions change, safety advisories are issued, or local events impact planned activities. The lack of dynamic data integration renders plans obsolete and potentially unsafe.</p>

<p>Fourth, conventional platforms lack sophisticated budget control and filtering mechanisms that allow users to discover plans matching their financial constraints and personal preferences. Users must manually evaluate whether shared plans fit their budget, leading to wasted time reviewing irrelevant content.</p>

<p>Fifth, existing systems do not provide clear monetization pathways for plan creators, platforms, or sponsors. The absence of integrated monetization mechanisms prevents sustainable business models for community planning platforms and limits opportunities for commercial entities to reach relevant audiences with time-sensitive or location-specific offerings.</p>

<p>Sixth, prior art systems fail to establish clear ownership and editing rights when users copy community-shared plans. Ambiguity regarding whether copied plans remain linked to originals versus becoming independent user-owned content creates confusion and limits user confidence in modifying shared plans.</p>

<p>Therefore, there exists a need for an improved system and method that generates AI-powered plans enriched with location-based and real-time data, categorizes and ranks plans using multi-tier badge systems reflecting urgency and commercial value, enables budget-controlled discovery and filtering, provides clear monetization mechanisms, and establishes unambiguous ownership and editing rights for community-shared plans.</p>

<h2>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h2>

<p>The present invention addresses the aforementioned limitations by providing a comprehensive system and method for categorizing, ranking, and distributing AI-powered community plans with integrated monetization strategies. The invention leverages artificial intelligence to generate personalized plans incorporating location-based and real-time data, presents plans through a hierarchical badge categorization system, enables community sharing with clear ownership transfer, and implements budget-based filtering and priority ranking mechanisms.</p>

<p>In accordance with one embodiment, the invention comprises a computer-implemented method for generating and distributing AI-powered community plans. The method includes: receiving user input defining planning parameters including origin location, destination, duration, budget constraints, and occasion type; querying one or more artificial intelligence models to generate a structured plan comprising activities, tasks, scheduling, and resource allocation; enriching the generated plan with location-based real-time data including current weather conditions, safety advisories, traffic patterns, and local events; assigning a hierarchical badge category to the plan selected from a plurality of badge types including Emergency badges for urgent safety-critical information, Sponsored badges for commercially promoted content, Trending badges for high-engagement popular content, and Community badges for user-generated non-commercial content; calculating a priority ranking score based on badge type, user engagement metrics, temporal relevance, and location proximity; displaying the plan in a discovery interface ordered by priority ranking score; and upon user selection to copy a displayed plan, creating a new user-owned instance of the plan with full editing rights independent of the original plan.</p>

<p>The hierarchical badge system establishes a clear priority order wherein Emergency badges receive highest priority for time-critical safety information such as natural disasters, travel advisories, or urgent public health alerts. Sponsored badges receive second-tier priority, enabling commercial entities to promote relevant plans while generating platform revenue. Trending badges identify organically popular community content based on engagement metrics including view counts, copy rates, and completion statistics. Community badges designate standard user-generated content without commercial promotion or trending status.</p>

<p>The invention further includes sophisticated budget control mechanisms enabling users to filter discoverable plans based on estimated total costs. Each plan includes budget metadata calculated by summing projected costs for activities, accommodations, transportation, and other resource expenditures. Users specify maximum budget thresholds, and the system filters displayed plans to show only those meeting budget criteria, preventing wasted time reviewing financially infeasible options.</p>

<p>The real-time data integration component continuously queries external data sources including weather services, government safety advisory systems, traffic monitoring systems, and event calendars. When conditions change affecting a plan's viability or safety, the system updates plan metadata, adjusts priority rankings, and in critical cases, promotes plans to Emergency badge status with prominent visual indicators alerting users to changed conditions.</p>

<p>The ownership and editing model establishes that when a user copies a community-shared plan, the copied plan becomes a new independent entity fully owned by the copying user with unrestricted editing rights. Modifications to copied plans do not affect original plans, and original plan creators have no visibility into or control over copied plan modifications. This clear ownership transfer model encourages community sharing by eliminating concerns about unauthorized modifications to original content while empowering users to freely customize copied plans.</p>

<p>The monetization strategy enables multiple revenue streams including: sponsored plan placement fees from commercial entities seeking to promote plans to targeted audiences; subscription tiers providing enhanced features such as unlimited plan generation, advanced filtering, and plan analytics; and potential future revenue sharing with high-performing community plan creators. The badge system's explicit designation of Sponsored content maintains transparency while enabling sustainable platform economics.</p>

<h2>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</h2>

<h3>System Architecture Overview</h3>

<p>Referring to FIG. 1, the invention comprises several interconnected modules operating in coordination to deliver the complete functionality. The AI Planning Engine 100 receives user inputs and generates structured plans. The Real-Time Data Enrichment Module 200 queries external data sources and integrates current information into plans. The Badge Categorization and Ranking Engine 300 assigns badge types and calculates priority scores. The Monetization Module 400 manages sponsored placements and revenue processing. The Discovery Interface 500 presents plans to users with filtering and sorting capabilities. The Community Sharing Module 600 handles plan copying, ownership transfer, and editing rights management.</p>

<h3>AI Planning Engine</h3>

<p>The AI Planning Engine 100 interfaces with one or more large language model APIs to generate comprehensive plans based on user-provided parameters. In one embodiment, the engine queries OpenAI's GPT-4 model, Anthropic's Claude model, or other comparable AI systems. The engine implements a multi-turn conversation flow that progressively gathers planning requirements through structured questions.</p>

<p>For rapid planning scenarios, the engine employs a Quick Plan mode requesting five essential parameters: origin location, destination location, duration, budget range, and occasion type. The AI model processes these inputs and generates a preliminary plan structure including recommended activities, time allocations, and resource requirements.</p>

<p>For comprehensive planning scenarios, the engine employs a Smart Plan mode gathering up to ten parameters through a three-batch question flow. Additional parameters may include accommodation preferences, dietary restrictions, mobility considerations, group size, and activity intensity preferences. The expanded parameter set enables generation of highly personalized plans matching specific user requirements.</p>

<p>The engine includes validation logic preventing accidental plan completion before users provide sufficient information. The system detects override keywords such as "create plan now" allowing users to bypass remaining questions, while preventing ambiguous inputs from prematurely triggering plan generation.</p>

<p>Generated plans conform to a standardized data structure including: plan title, description, total estimated budget, activity list with individual activities containing descriptions, estimated costs, duration, and location coordinates, task checklist items, and scheduling information. This structured format enables consistent processing by downstream modules.</p>

<h3>Real-Time Data Enrichment Module</h3>

<p>The Real-Time Data Enrichment Module 200 enhances AI-generated plans with current information from external data sources. The module queries weather APIs to retrieve forecasts for destination locations during planned travel dates. Weather data includes temperature ranges, precipitation probability, severe weather warnings, and seasonal condition assessments.</p>

<p>The module queries government travel advisory systems and safety databases to identify relevant warnings, travel restrictions, natural disasters, political unrest, health advisories, and other safety-critical information affecting destination locations. When critical safety issues are detected, the module flags plans for potential Emergency badge assignment.</p>

<p>Traffic and transportation data sources provide current travel time estimates, road closures, public transit disruptions, and transportation cost updates. This information ensures plan timing remains realistic and identifies potential logistical challenges.</p>

<p>Local event calendars and tourism databases supply information about festivals, concerts, sporting events, seasonal attractions, and temporary closures that may impact planned activities. Event data enables the AI Planning Engine to suggest relevant activities and avoid scheduling conflicts.</p>

<p>The enrichment process occurs both at initial plan generation and through periodic background updates for saved plans. When real-time data indicates significant changes affecting plan viability, the system notifies plan owners and updates plan status accordingly.</p>

<h3>Badge Categorization and Ranking Engine</h3>

<p>The Badge Categorization and Ranking Engine 300 assigns hierarchical badge designations to plans and calculates priority ranking scores determining display order in the Discovery Interface. Referring to FIG. 2, the badge system implements four distinct categories with descending priority: Emergency, Sponsored, Trending, and Community.</p>

<p>Emergency badges are assigned to plans containing urgent safety-critical information requiring immediate user attention. Assignment criteria include: detection of active natural disasters affecting plan locations such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, or wildfires; government-issued travel warnings or restrictions; public health emergencies; or other time-sensitive safety concerns. Emergency badged plans receive maximum priority scores ensuring prominent display positioning. Visual presentation includes distinctive red coloring and warning iconography alerting users to urgency.</p>

<p>Sponsored badges are assigned to plans for which commercial entities have paid placement fees. The Monetization Module 400 processes sponsor payments and marks eligible plans for Sponsored badge assignment. Sponsored plans receive second-tier priority scores below Emergency but above Trending and Community badges. Visual presentation includes distinctive purple coloring and sponsor designation clearly identifying commercial content while maintaining professional appearance. Sponsored badge placement enables sustainable platform revenue while providing value to commercial entities seeking to reach relevant audiences.</p>

<p>Trending badges are assigned to organically popular community plans based on engagement metrics. The engine calculates engagement scores by aggregating: view counts weighted by recency, copy/adoption rates, task completion rates from users who adopted the plan, and user ratings or feedback when available. Plans exceeding dynamically adjusted trending thresholds receive Trending badge assignments. Trending badges employ gold coloring signifying popular high-quality content. Trending status creates positive feedback loops where popular plans receive enhanced visibility, encouraging quality content creation.</p>

<p>Community badges represent the baseline category for user-generated plans without Emergency status, commercial sponsorship, or trending popularity. Community badges employ neutral gray coloring and standard visual presentation. While Community badged plans receive lower priority scores than other categories, high-quality Community plans can achieve Trending status through organic engagement, providing upward mobility within the badge hierarchy.</p>

<p>The priority ranking algorithm combines badge type with additional factors including: temporal relevance scoring plans matching current seasons or upcoming dates higher; location proximity scoring plans near user's current location or stated interests higher; user preference matching based on historical plan adoptions and expressed interests; and recency factors preventing stale content from dominating results. The weighted combination of these factors produces numerical priority scores used for sorting plans in the Discovery Interface.</p>

<h3>Monetization Module</h3>

<p>The Monetization Module 400 implements revenue generation mechanisms supporting sustainable platform operations. The module manages multiple revenue streams tailored to different stakeholder needs.</p>

<p>Sponsored plan placement fees enable commercial entities including tourism boards, hospitality providers, event organizers, and travel companies to promote relevant plans to targeted audiences. The module provides sponsor account management, payment processing via integration with payment processors such as Stripe, placement budget configuration, and performance analytics showing impression counts, click-through rates, and adoption metrics. Sponsors create or designate existing plans for promotion, configure target audience parameters such as geographic regions and budget ranges, and fund placement campaigns. The module calculates cost-per-impression or cost-per-action billing and processes payments through secure payment gateways.</p>

<p>Subscription tier monetization offers tiered service levels to end users. A free tier provides limited monthly plan generations (e.g., 5 plans per month) with unlimited plan browsing and real-time data access. A Pro tier priced at monthly subscription rates (e.g., $6.99/month) provides unlimited plan generation, advanced filtering options, plan export capabilities, and analytics showing plan performance. A Family tier priced at higher monthly rates (e.g., $14.99/month) extends Pro benefits to multiple user accounts (e.g., up to 5 users) and adds collaborative planning features. The module tracks usage limits, processes recurring subscription payments, manages trial periods, and enforces tier-appropriate feature access.</p>

<p>The module implements usage tracking counters monitoring plan generation counts against tier limits. When free tier users approach or exceed limits, the system presents upgrade prompts encouraging subscription conversion. Payment processing integration handles secure credit card processing, subscription renewals, cancellations, and refund processing following platform policies.</p>

<h3>Discovery Interface and Filtering</h3>

<p>The Discovery Interface 500, illustrated in FIG. 2, presents community plans to users with comprehensive filtering, sorting, and search capabilities. The interface displays plans as visual cards containing: plan title, creator attribution, destination location, estimated budget, badge designation with appropriate visual styling, preview image representative of destination or activity, brief description, and engagement metrics such as adoption counts.</p>

<p>Budget filtering enables users to specify maximum total budget thresholds. The interface includes slider controls or numeric input fields for setting budget limits. Upon budget filter application, the system queries the plan database for plans with total estimated costs at or below the specified threshold, displaying only budget-appropriate results. This filtering prevents users from reviewing plans financially out of reach, significantly improving discovery efficiency.</p>

<p>Category filtering enables users to narrow results by plan type categories such as travel plans, event plans, project plans, or custom categories. Users select desired categories via checkbox or dropdown controls, and the system filters results accordingly.</p>

<p>Location filtering allows users to specify geographic regions, countries, states, or cities of interest. The system filters plans based on primary destination locations, showing only geographically relevant results.</p>

<p>Duration filtering enables users to specify trip or project length preferences such as weekend trips, week-long vacations, or multi-week expeditions. The system filters plans matching duration criteria.</p>

<p>Sorting controls allow users to reorder results by different criteria including: priority score (default), showing highest-priority Emergency and Sponsored plans first; budget (low to high or high to low); popularity based on adoption counts; or recency showing newest plans first. Sort order preference enables users to prioritize different discovery factors based on current needs.</p>

<p>Search functionality enables free-text keyword searching across plan titles, descriptions, locations, and activity content. The system executes database queries matching search terms and displays relevant results, with optional search highlighting showing matched terms.</p>

<h3>Community Sharing and Ownership Transfer</h3>

<p>The Community Sharing Module 600 implements mechanisms for users to share created plans with the community and for other users to copy, own, and edit shared plans. The module establishes clear ownership and editing rights preventing ambiguity.</p>

<p>When a user completes plan generation via the AI Planning Engine, the system presents options to save the plan as private (visible only to the creating user) or share with the community (visible in Discovery Interface). Users selecting community sharing consent to making the plan publicly discoverable while retaining ownership of the original plan instance.</p>

<p>Community-shared plans appear in the Discovery Interface subject to badge categorization and filtering as previously described. Users browsing the Discovery Interface can view plan details and select "Copy Plan" or "Use This Plan" actions.</p>

<p>Upon copy action, the Community Sharing Module creates a new plan database record containing all data from the original plan including activities, tasks, budget information, and locations. Critically, the new plan record establishes the copying user as the owner, with no linkage to the original plan beyond initial data copying. The copied plan becomes an independent entity with its own database identifier, edit history, and access controls.</p>

<p>The copying user receives full editing rights over the copied plan, including: ability to add, remove, or modify activities; adjust scheduling and time allocations; update budget estimates; add or remove tasks; change plan titles and descriptions; and mark tasks as completed. Editing operations modify only the copied plan instance, with zero effect on the original shared plan.</p>

<p>This ownership transfer model contrasts with reference-based systems where copied content maintains links to originals. By creating fully independent copies, the invention eliminates several problems: original plan creators cannot see modifications to copied plans, preventing privacy concerns when users personalize plans with sensitive information; changes to original plans do not propagate to copies, preventing unexpected modifications to user-customized plans; users can freely modify copied plans without concerns about affecting other users; and the system avoids complex synchronization logic managing relationships between originals and copies.</p>

<p>The module implements duplicate detection logic identifying when users attempt to copy plans they previously copied. Upon detecting duplicate copy attempts, the system presents confirmation dialogs offering to update the user's existing copy or create a new independent copy. This prevents unintended proliferation of identical plan copies in user accounts while supporting use cases where users intentionally want multiple variations of similar plans.</p>

<h3>Priority System Implementation</h3>

<p>The priority system integrates badge hierarchy with additional ranking factors to optimize plan discovery. The system assigns base priority scores according to badge type: Emergency badges receive base scores in the range 9000-10000; Sponsored badges receive base scores in the range 7000-8999; Trending badges receive base scores in the range 5000-6999; and Community badges receive base scores in the range 1000-4999.</p>

<p>Modifier calculations adjust base scores based on supplementary factors. Temporal relevance modifiers increase scores for plans matching current or upcoming seasons. Location proximity modifiers increase scores for plans near user locations or expressed interests. Engagement velocity modifiers increase Trending badge scores for plans showing accelerating adoption rates. Recency modifiers provide slight boosts to newer plans preventing excessive dominance by older established content.</p>

<p>The weighted combination of base scores and modifiers produces final priority scores used for sorting Discovery Interface results. The algorithm ensures Emergency content always appears first regardless of other factors, followed by Sponsored content, then Trending content, and finally Community content, while allowing high-performing content within each tier to outrank lower-performing content within the same tier.</p>

<h3>Data Privacy and User Control</h3>

<p>The system implements data privacy protections respecting user confidentiality. User-generated plans marked as private remain inaccessible to other users and excluded from Discovery Interface results. Community-shared plans display creator attribution but do not expose personally identifiable information unless users explicitly include such information in plan content.</p>

<p>Users retain control over their shared plans via management interfaces enabling conversion of community-shared plans back to private status, removing them from Discovery Interface results. Users can delete their created plans, permanently removing them from the system. However, previously copied instances of deleted plans remain in copying users' accounts, consistent with the ownership transfer model.</p>

<h3>Technical Implementation Details</h3>

<p>In one embodiment, the system operates as a web-based application accessible via standard web browsers. The frontend interface implements responsive design supporting mobile devices, tablets, and desktop computers. The backend comprises Node.js/Express server applications interfacing with PostgreSQL relational databases storing plan data, user accounts, badges, engagement metrics, and transaction records.</p>

<p>API integrations connect the system to external services including: OpenAI and Anthropic AI model APIs for plan generation; Tavily API for real-time web search and data enrichment; weather service APIs such as OpenWeatherMap or Weather.gov; government travel advisory APIs; traffic and transportation APIs such as Google Maps or similar services; event calendar and tourism databases; and payment processing APIs such as Stripe for monetization functions.</p>

<p>The database schema includes tables for users, plans, activities, tasks, badges, engagement metrics, subscriptions, and sponsored placements. Foreign key relationships maintain referential integrity while the ownership transfer model intentionally avoids creating references from copied plans back to original plans.</p>

<p>Caching mechanisms improve performance by temporarily storing API responses from external data sources, reducing redundant API calls and improving response times. Cache invalidation logic ensures data freshness by expiring cached weather, traffic, and safety data after appropriate time periods.</p>

<p>The system implements authentication and authorization controls verifying user identities via OAuth providers such as Google, Facebook, Apple, and email-based accounts. Authorization logic enforces access controls ensuring users can only edit plans they own and cannot access other users' private plans.</p>
