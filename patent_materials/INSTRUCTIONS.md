# Patent Filing Materials - Ready for USPTO Upload

## ✅ Materials Created

### 1. System Architecture Flowchart
**Location:** `patent_materials/system-flowchart.html`

**To capture as image for USPTO:**
1. Open the file in your browser (just double-click it)
2. Take a full-page screenshot (Command+Shift+4 on Mac, Windows+Shift+S on Windows)
3. Save as `Figure-1-System-Architecture.png`

**What it shows:**
- User input flow (search, browse, filters)
- Discovery engine processing
- AI ranking algorithm (the core innovation!)
- Badge classification system (Emergency/Sponsored/Trending/Community)
- Monetization engine integration
- Database architecture
- User action paths (preview, adopt)

### 2. Discovery Page Screenshot
**How to capture:**
1. Go to your app: http://localhost:5000/discover
2. Make sure you can see several community plans with:
   - Different badge types (Emergency, Sponsored, Trending)
   - Verification icons (X/Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn checkmarks)
   - Budget amounts
   - Like/view counts
3. Take screenshot and save as `Figure-2-Discovery-Interface.png`

**Optional: Capture hover preview**
- Hover over a plan card to show the summary tooltip
- Screenshot that too: `Figure-3-Hover-Preview.png`

## 📝 Next Step: Write Your Description

Your provisional patent needs a written description (10-20 pages). Here's the outline:

### Required Sections:

**1. Title**
System and Method for Categorizing, Ranking, and Distributing AI-Powered Community Plans with Monetization

**2. Field of Invention**
"This invention relates to systems and methods for discovering, verifying, and distributing user-generated content using artificial intelligence and algorithmic ranking, specifically for lifestyle planning and community-driven plan sharing platforms."

**3. Background**
- Problem: Users struggle to find trustworthy, relevant plans from vast community content
- Prior art lacks: automated verification, location-based discovery, and intelligent ranking
- Need for: transparent trust signals and monetization framework

**4. Summary**
Brief description of your system (2-3 paragraphs covering the flowchart)

**5. Detailed Description** (THE KEY SECTION)
Reference your figures and explain:
- How the discovery engine filters plans (Fig. 1, Discovery Engine box)
- How the ranking algorithm works (Fig. 1, AI Ranking Algorithm box)
- How badges are assigned (Fig. 1, Badge Classification diamond)
- How sponsored content is inserted (Fig. 1, Monetization Engine)
- How users interact with the system (Fig. 2, Discovery Interface)

**6. Claims** (Optional for provisional but recommended)
Broad statements of what you're protecting:
- Claim 1: A system for discovering community-generated plans comprising...
- Claim 2: A method for ranking said plans using engagement metrics, verification status, and trending algorithms...
- Claim 3: A method for monetizing plan distribution through sponsored content placement...
