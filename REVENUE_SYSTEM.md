# JournalMate Revenue System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a freemium subscription revenue model using Stripe, designed to maximize user acquisition through generous free tier limits while converting power users to paid plans.

## Revenue Tiers

- **5 AI plans per month** with automatic monthly reset
- **Unlimited real-time data enrichment** (weather, safety alerts, travel info)
- Access to all core features: journaling, task management, activity tracking
- No credit card required
- Perfect for casual users and trial period

### Pro Tier - $6.99/month
- **Unlimited AI plans** per month
- Smart favorites organization (filter, search, categorize)
- Journal insights and analytics
- Export functionality (CSV/JSON)
- Priority support
- **7-day free trial** (no credit card required)
- **Annual plan: $58.99/year** (save 30%)

### Family Tier - $14.99/month

- Up to 5 family members
- Shared plans and activities
- Family progress tracking
- Collaborative planning features
- **7-day free trial** (no credit card required)
- **Annual plan: $125.99/year** (save 30%)

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
Added to `users` table in `shared/schema.ts`:
```typescript
subscriptionTier: varchar("subscription_tier").default('free'),
subscriptionStatus: varchar("subscription_status").default('active'),
planCount: integer("plan_count").default(0),
planCountResetDate: timestamp("plan_count_reset_date"),
stripeCustomerId: varchar("stripe_customer_id"),
stripeSubscriptionId: varchar("stripe_subscription_id"),
```

### API Routes (`server/routes.ts`)

#### Subscription Management
- `POST /api/subscription/checkout` - Create Stripe checkout session
- `POST /api/subscription/webhook` - Handle Stripe webhook events
- `GET /api/subscription/portal` - Access customer billing portal
- `GET /api/subscription/status` - Check current subscription status

#### Usage Tracking
- Plan count incremented when activity is created from AI conversation
- Monthly reset on billing cycle (tracked via `planCountResetDate`)
- Feature gating checks `planCount` before allowing plan creation

### Stripe Integration
Using Replit's Stripe blueprint with secure environment variables:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Server-side API key
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` - Client-side publishable key

Products configured in Stripe Dashboard:
- Pro Monthly: `price_pro_monthly`
- Pro Annual: `price_pro_annual`
- Family Monthly: `price_family_monthly`
- Family Annual: `price_family_annual`

### Frontend Components

#### UpgradeModal (`client/src/components/UpgradeModal.tsx`)
Conversion-optimized modal with:
- Dynamic trigger messages based on context (plan limit, favorites, export, insights)
- Side-by-side pricing comparison
- Clear feature differentiation
- Monthly/annual toggle with savings highlight
- "Best Value" badge on Family plan
- Test IDs for analytics tracking

Trigger contexts:
- `planLimit` - When user hits 5 plans on free tier
- `favorites` - When accessing advanced favorites features
- `export` - When attempting data export
- `insights` - When accessing journal analytics

## User Experience Flow

### Free User Journey
1. User signs up → Starts with 5 free AI plans
2. Creates 1-4 plans → Seamless experience, no friction
3. Creates 5th plan → Still works, but shows subtle "upgrade available" hint
4. Attempts 6th plan → **Upgrade modal appears** with conversion messaging
5. Can still use all other features (journal, tasks, real-time data)

### Conversion Flow
1. User clicks upgrade → UpgradeModal displays pricing
2. Selects plan (monthly/annual) → Redirected to Stripe Checkout
3. Completes payment → Webhook updates `subscriptionStatus` and `subscriptionTier`
4. Returns to app → Immediately unlocked (no page refresh needed)
5. Can now create unlimited plans

### Subscription Management
Users can manage subscriptions via Stripe Customer Portal:
- Upgrade from Pro to Family
- Downgrade from Family to Pro
- Update payment methods
- Cancel subscription (keeps access until period end)
- View billing history

## Critical Design Decisions

### Why 5 Plans on Free Tier?
- High enough to demonstrate value (users can test multiple scenarios)
- Low enough to convert power users (serious users hit limit quickly)
- Generous compared to competitors (builds goodwill and trust)
- Monthly reset prevents one-time users from blocking conversion

### Why Keep Real-Time Data Free?
Per user requirement, real-time enrichment (weather, safety alerts, local events) stays free because:
- Differentiates from pure "AI chat" competitors
- Builds trust through utility before asking for payment
- Creates viral moments (users share impressive real-time plans)
- Only gates the AI planning generation, not the data itself

### Why 7-Day Free Trial?
- Standard industry practice for SaaS
- No credit card required → reduces signup friction
- Long enough for users to integrate into routine
- Automated via Stripe subscription trials

## Revenue Metrics to Track

### Conversion Funnel
1. **Free signups** → Track total registrations
2. **Plan creation rate** → How many users create their first plan?
3. **5-plan limit hits** → How many users reach the free tier ceiling?
4. **Upgrade modal views** → How often is conversion opportunity shown?
5. **Trial starts** → How many users begin 7-day trial?
6. **Trial conversions** → How many trials convert to paid?

### Retention Metrics
- Monthly active users (MAU)
- Plan creation frequency
- Churn rate by tier
- Feature usage by tier (favorites, export, insights)

## Next Steps for Production

### Before Launch
1. **Create Stripe products** in production dashboard:
   - Configure price IDs for all plans (monthly/annual)
   - Set up webhook endpoint URL
   - Test webhook signatures

2. **Configure production secrets** via Replit:
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (production key)
   - `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` (production publishable key)

3. **Implement missing features**:
   - Monthly plan count reset scheduler (cron job)
   - Stripe webhook signature validation
   - Subscription status sync on app load
   - Upgrade modal integration in MainApp

4. **Test end-to-end flows**:
   - Free user → 5 plans → upgrade prompt
   - Checkout → payment → webhook → unlock
   - Trial expiration → auto-convert or cancel
   - Subscription cancellation → access until period end

### Post-Launch Optimizations
1. **A/B test conversion copy** in UpgradeModal
2. **Add usage stats** to profile ("You've used 3 of 5 plans this month")
3. **Send upgrade emails** when users hit 4/5 plans
4. **Create referral program** (give both users +2 free plans)
5. **Add annual plan discount countdown** ("Save 30% - ends soon!")
